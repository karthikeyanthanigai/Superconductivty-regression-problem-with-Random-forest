# Superconductivty-regression-problem-with-Random-forest
In this repository we will see what is this Superconductivty(regression problem) parameters/variable values and try to fit this values in a Random forest regression.
We already done this problem in [Decision tree method](https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/Superconductivty-regression-problem-with-Decision-tree..git) and we got an Accuracy(r_square value) of 85%.In this method we will try to improve it using random forest regression!!
